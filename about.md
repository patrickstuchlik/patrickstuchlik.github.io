Hello! My name is Patrick Stuchlik. I absolutely love thinking creatively and working with data. 

My background is in epidemiology and biostatistics (PhD, [Tulane University,](https://sph.tulane.edu/epid/home) 2018). After graduate school, I was a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF's [Center](https://popbrain.ucsf.edu/) for Population Brain Health.

Recently I completed The Data Incubator's fellowship program, and I am excited to pursue data science opportunities!
