My name is Patrick Stuchlik. I love finding data, analyzing it, and then finding a creative and aesthetically pleasing way of presenting my findings.

My background is in epidemiology and biostatistics (PhD, [Tulane University,](https://sph.tulane.edu/epid/home) 2018). After graduate school, I was a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF's [Center](https://popbrain.ucsf.edu/) for Population Brain Health.

Recently I completed The Data Incubator's [fellowship](https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html) program, where I gained expertise in Python and other data science technologies, and I am excited to pursue data science opportunities!
